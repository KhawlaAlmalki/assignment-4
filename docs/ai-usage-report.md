# **AI Usage Report**

## **Tools Used & Use Cases**

### **ChatGPT (GPT-5)**
Served as a development partner throughout the project, providing guidance, explanations, and troubleshooting.

#### **Stage 1 — Structure & Design**
- Helped build the initial HTML/CSS structure using semantic elements and responsive units.
- Guided the adoption of a clean, Apple-inspired visual style.
- Supported organizing the main sections (About Me, Experience, Projects, Contact) with a clear hierarchy.

#### **Stage 2 — Interactivity & Logic**
- Assisted in adding smooth scroll animations with `IntersectionObserver`.
- Helped implement the **interactive Projects section** (search, filter, sort).
- Guided the creation of collapsible **Experience Timeline** items with keyboard-accessible controls (`aria-expanded`, Enter/Space).
- Helped integrate the fixed weather widget displaying **emoji + temperature + live timer** (`☀️ 16°C | 01:25`).

#### **Stage 3 — State Management & Persistence**
- Supported implementing `localStorage` for:
    - remembering dark/light mode
    - saving contact form input
    - preserving experience collapse state
    - maintaining the Show/Hide Experience toggle
- Helped refactor JavaScript into clean, modular functions.

#### **Stage 4 — Documentation & Presentation**
- Assisted in drafting and refining technical documentation in Markdown.
- Ensured clarity, structure, and consistency in explaining implementation details.

## **Benefits & Challenges**

### **Benefits**
- **Accelerated development** through reusable code snippets and debugging help.
- **Improved UI design** in spacing, typography scale, accessibility, and dark mode behavior.
- **Deepened understanding of JavaScript**, including DOM manipulation, timers, observers, and event-driven logic.
- **Better documentation**, thanks to help structuring and polishing text.

### **Challenges**
- Some generated solutions were overly advanced and required simplification.
- Occasionally needed to merge and debug conflicting snippets manually.
- Accessibility features (e.g., ARIA and keyboard navigation) required testing.
- Terminal commands were sometimes Linux-based and needed Windows adaptations.

---

## **Learning Outcomes**
- Developed strong skills in **modular JavaScript** and event-driven programming.
- Learned to integrate **client-side persistence** using `localStorage`.
- Improved understanding of **responsive design**, CSS organization, and section-based layout.
- Strengthened debugging abilities, especially when adapting AI-generated code.
- Enhanced my technical writing skills when documenting project structure and features.

---

## **Responsible Use of AI**
- Used AI as an **educational tool**, not a final-output generator.
- Rewrote and customized all AI suggestions to match my understanding and project requirements.
- Ensured all personal sections (About Me, Projects, Achievements) were written authentically.
- Simplified or refactored complex suggestions to maintain clarity and assignment suitability.
- Manually tested every feature (filters, timers, weather API, state logic) for correct functionality.

## **Summary Reflection**
Using AI responsibly added depth and value to this project. Instead of simply generating code, ChatGPT acted as a **teaching assistant**, offering explanations, alternatives, and refinements.

This collaboration helped transform a standard portfolio into a more interactive, well-engineered application with:

- dynamic UI logic
- state management
- persistent storage
- real-time features (weather + timer)
- refined design principles

The final portfolio reflects **my own development effort**, enhanced through structured, transparent, and ethical use of AI tools.
